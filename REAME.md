## 📦 Project Overview

**PanePilot** is a lightweight background service designed for maximum productivity with minimum memory usage.  
It lives quietly in your Windows tray and pops up smart layout suggestions whenever you summon it — no heavy Electron apps, no bloated memory usage.

Built to be efficient **today**, and ready to integrate **AI-assisted layouts** **tomorrow**.

## 🚀 Features
- ⚡ **Fast and light** — runs under 50MB RAM.
- 🖱️ **Tray icon** — right-click to show suggestions or exit.
- ⌨️ **Global hotkey** (default: `Ctrl + Alt + 2`) to open the layout selector instantly.
- 🧠 **Random layouts** (for now) — designed to be swapped out later for smarter AI suggestions.
- 🖥️ **Lightweight Webview UI** — no bloated frontends.
